CHANGES

May 10th 2024  8 PM
- fixed the timer to actually work (yiipe)
- added data to all tables to make stuff print
for now, only tomato appears when clicking on recipe, but the others dont
- changed properties to some databases. This includes:
quantity is now set to VarChar since we can have some recipes where the quantity is up to the user ("Choose your amount for your taste")
- Variables like ingredient name or recipe name now have the property of "UNIQUE" so that you can't have the same ingredient twice or recipe

-Debugging with the command: DBCC CHECKIDENT ('Ingredient', RESEED, 1);
this basically forces the sql to create  ID number of whatever is in the 3rd parameter. (if record 4 is deleted including ID 4)
Usually it will just skip and continue counting to id 500 or whatever. this reseeding forces it to re create the id. you do have to manually
go to the right id tho with the reseeding if you want it to work normally

Creation page is fully finished. 
One problem would be to find a way to incorporate a relative path.
Right now it is being hardcoded to my system's path's base database. the reason why the data doesnt save was because 
it would save it in the debug databse and not the base one
